First main issue:
Threads conflicting - tkinter, then pyside6 all use a main thread and therefore i had DEBUG errors due to library specific threading needed

second issue:
[DEBUG] imported etw successfully
monitoring: [(11452, 'Notepad.exe')]
[DEBUG] __init__ with pids: [11452]
[DEBUG] tracking PID 11452 Notepad.exe
[DEBUG] started
[DEBUG] starting thread
[DEBUG] _run_trace() entered on thread
[DEBUG] loaded 2 providers
[DEBUG] creating etw instance
[DEBUG] etw instance created
[DEBUG] calling etw.start()
[DEBUG] thread started
[DEBUG] etw.start() stopped
[DEBUG] _run_trace() exiting

as you can see above, etw instance automatically closes.
this could be due to several reasons, but i think in my case its conflicting session names

after adding dynamic session name swe get the same result
im thinking we might be using outdated pywintrace usage ( i took code from example uses)
